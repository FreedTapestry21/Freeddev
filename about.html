                              Hey there, I am Freed. <br>
                              I'm a 15 year old bisexual human who loves technology. <br>
                              I do a lot with programming and tinkering with software and electronics. <br>
                              <br>
                              I do know some of the programming languages out there, like: Python and a bit of Javascript.<br>
                              And I mean, HTML and CSS aren't really programming languages, but I do know those as well. <br>
                              There are also some programming languages which I am still in the process of learning like Rust and C. <br>
                              <br>
                              Oh yeah and not to forget, I am obsessed with Linux and smaller electronics, like Raspberry Pi's or Arduino's. <br>
                              <br>

                         <p>
                              The year of portable operating systems. <br>
                              I started tinkering with different operating systems. <br>
                              Especially Windows and FreeDOS. <br>
                              Back then I also discovered on how to boot Windows or FreeDOS from a USB drive. <br>
                              I also had my first encounter with Linux on my first Raspberry Pi. <br>

                         <p>
                              The year of ...being home? <br>
                              In this year I started making a lot of Minecraft servers.  <br>
                              Thanks to this I learned about port forwarding and a bit about infrastructure. <br>
                              I also bought my first Arduino in this year, which I liked to tinker with. <br>
                              And not to forget, I tried to make this exact website, which back then failed. <br>

                         <p>
                              The year of Raspberry Pi. <br>
                              In January 2021 I kinda destroyed my previous Raspberry Pi so I bought a new one. <br>
                              I used this Raspberry pi as my server. And it's still online untill this day. <br>
                              I also did a lot of small little Arduino projects in this year. <br>
                              For example, I made a GUI for my Arduino with a mouse cursor and all. <br>
                              Sadly, I never really used it in any kind of larger project. <br>

                         <p>
                              The year of Linux. <br>
                              Around October 2021 I tried to install Zorin OS onto an external drive with no success. <br>
                              So January 2022 I tried again, and it worked. <br>
                              I started with Zorin OS and then started distro hopping. <br>
                              Eventually in June 2022 I stopped at Arch Linux where I'm still at to this day. <br>
                              I also setup 2 more servers.  <br>
                              A Raspberry Pi 400, which I use for my VPN and personal Minecraft server. <br>
                              And an old Acer Aspire 8943G, which I use for almost everything server related. <br>
